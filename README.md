# Design Patterns
A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.

Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:

1. Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can use in our java based projects.
1. Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
1. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories 
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creation Design Patterns
1. #####Singleton Pattern

   Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java virtual machine. It seems to be a very simple design pattern but when it comes to implementation, it comes with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of the Singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers. Check out Singleton Design Pattern to learn about different ways to implement Singleton pattern and pros and cons of each of the method. This is one of the most discussed java design patterns.
